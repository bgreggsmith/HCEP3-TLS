#Analysis Definition File (ADF)
#This file should really be more config-like but at the moment things are executed and loaded in the order they appear in this file
#It is therefore imperative the mesh is loaded prior to performing any operations with boundary conditions and field values

#define source file for mesh
meshfile mesh.su2

#set up boundary conditions based on cell tags
bctag inlet constant p 1.5E5
bctag outlet constant p 1.2E5
bctag wall constant ux 0

bgfield uy 0
bgfield p 1.2E5

#set up time control
